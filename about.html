<p> <b> After to winning the second period of The Next Food Network Star on April 23, 2006, Fieri was granted a six-episode responsibility for his own preparing show on Food Network. Guyâ€™s Big Bite then premiered on June 25, 2006. Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, his second series, debuted in April 2007, with Fieri venturing to every part of the nation visiting neighborhood restaurants. The New York Times referred to the series as "not a cooking show as much as a carefully engineered reality show." Ultimate Recipe Showdown, co-hosted with Marc Summers, debuted on February 17, 2008 and aired for three seasons. On September 14, 2008, Guy Off the Hook debuted on Food Network. This special studio audience show broadcasted through the end of 2008. However, the extra cost of staging an audience show did not result in a ratings bump and the concept was discontinued. For Thanksgiving 2008, Fieri hosted a one-hour special titled Guy's Family Feast. He utilized the "Guy Off the Hook" set for the special, which was broadcasted live, on November 28, 2008. Fieri appeared on other Food Network shows like Dinner: Impossible in 2007 and 2009, Paula's Party, Ace of Cakes, and The Best Thing I Ever Ate.
